# Understanding Challenges with Large Robotics System Development

A small collection of study notes about challenges with large robotics system development.

Robotics system development (robosysdev) is hard.
As a first step towards overcoming the difficulties, I'd like to understand what makes the robosysdev challenging by analyzing data collected via a short series of interviews with robotics engineers.
