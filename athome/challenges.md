# Identified Challenges

## Technical

- manipulation
  - bi-hand
  - general manipulation that does not require strong assumptions
- human-in-the-loop control
  - modeling humans at multiple levels
- integration

- any closed-loop control
- human

- the field is not matured enough

  - the assumptions the techniques make do not hold
  - too much/precise requirements, no time
- testing is challenging
  - setting up a real world testing environment is challenging, esp, challenging to prepare the "reset"
  - the simulators do not serve the purpose they are designed for
    - inaccuracy - the gap between simulation and reality is too big
    - setting up and running experiments in simulation is too cumbersome
  - not enough time for thoroughly testing

TODO: add that one more note; and make it about

## Dev-ops is challenges

- difficult to identify what is important and fail to allocate to time optimally, which often only becomes clearer after the project is over
  - so it is easy to get stuck on a not-important issue
- existing dev-ops tools are unfit for the robotics dev culture
  - no ROS binding, no real-world continuous testing, no robotics data focused data logging/analysis/visualization options ...

## Human-factor is overlooked

- knowledge concentration problem - each team member knows their part thoroughly but do not know others' part and violates
- running the whole system is not practiced enough
  - mostly due to the time requirement of doing so
  - the importance of this practice is overlooked among inexperienced teams
