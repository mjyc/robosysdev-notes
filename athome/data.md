# Interview Data

The below notes are paraphrased from the notes taken down during the interview.

## Q1: What are the common technical challenges with @home tasks?

- Understanding the task descriptions
  - the teams are given with loose task descriptions
  - often, they prepare for the more challenging tasks than the actual tasks

- Manipulation
  - manipulation tasks involve the coordination of two arms
  - picking up cutlery or dishes
  - moving the table with a human
  - manipulating small objects on a non-standard tabletop
    - e.g., placing a knife on top of a dishwasher rack--can't tell whether the knife is picked-up/placed-down or not,
  - closed-loop control with limited perception
  - performing manipulation that meets constraints is done better than expected.

- side notes
  - the tasks are heavily influenced by the organizers; the organizers don't have vision people

## Q2: What are the common difficulties in preparing for the @home competition?

- The population of students who are well-suited for working on @home projects is small
  - the number of students who worked with a real robot is small
  - not too many students have experience with integrating multiple components
  - zeroing-in on one problem

- in fact, the above issue is true for other levels of engineers too
  - graduate students are highly specialized in one aspect of the bigger @home tasks. Their method often does not work if the basic assumption is not met and that happens a lot in real-world.
  - in industry, there are web devs, sys engs, dev ops, but not many robotics   generalist.

- time constraints
  - testing involving a real robot takes time
  - often make mistake to not allocate enough time for testing with a real robot

- side note
  - Peter's group does postmortem/retrospective
    - communication issues come up; sometimes related with social dynamics in the group (e.g., not mentioning critical problems to avoid additional work)

## Q3: What are the commonly occurring human-errors in @home competition?

- small mistake such as not sourcing the devel environment, etc.
- didn't localized the robot or did not meet other starting point requirements

- solutions some teams use
  - give the responsibility to a single person
