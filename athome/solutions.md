# (WIP) Brainstormed Solutions

## Principle-level

### Structural

- rewarding the team members for
  - developing and maintaining a component
  - coming up with ideas and experimenting with them
  - long-term impact - measures need to be developed

<!-- - management strategies
  - leading from within
  - aim for high goal alignment _and_ high team autonomy -->

### Engineering

<!-- - single owner, shared responsibility
  - one person is "owns" a component to set the vision and oversees the whole component
  - but the responsibility is shared across the team -->

- incremental engineering
  - frequent re-planning
  - infra-building on-the-fly

- investing time on building
  - tools that interoperates with existing devops tools
  - adaptive software
  - human operator interface

- clean separation between high-level logic component vs. sensor data processing component

## Tool-level

- time tracking tool
  - that go beyond coding time
